How to use Flexcore in your project
===================================

There are two supported ways to include flexcore in your own project. Both of
these methods assume you use cmake as your build configuration tool.

git submodule
-------------

Add the flexcore repository as a git submodule of your project.

    $ git submodule add <flexcore repo URL> flexcore

The root CMakeLists.txt of your project should then include the line:

    add_subdirectory(flexcore)

To link flexcore with one of your targets add the commands:

	add_executeable(main main.cpp)
	target_link_libraries(main flexcore)

to CMakeLists.txt. This will add the proper include directories, link flags
and will force building in c++14 mode.

When checking out your project remember to also checkout submodules:

    $ git submodule init && git submodule update
	$ (cd flexcore && git submodule init && git submodule update)

It is not necessary to integrate flexcore as a git submodule; if you know where
the source tree is located you can call add_subdirectory with the full path to
flexcore sources.

find_package
------------

This is the recommended way of including flexcore. First build and install flexcore.

    $ git clone <flexcore repo URL> flexcore
	$ mkdir -p flexcore/build && cd flexcore/build
	$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<my_prefix>
	$ make install

Once flexcore has been installed, your projects may use flexcore by including
the following in their CMakeLists.txt:

    find_package(flexcore)
	include_directories(${FLEXCORE_INCLUDE_DIRS})
	add_executable(main main.cpp)
	target_compile_options(main ${FLEXCORE_COMPILE_OPTIONS})
	# if you need the library components of flexcore, then this is sufficient
	# without specifying include_directories and target_compile_options)
	target_link_libraries(main ${FLEXCORE_LIBRARIES})

If you installed flexcore in a custom location then your cmake invocation will
probably need to include a value for flexcore_DIR (the path to the installed
flexcore-config.cmake).

    $ cmake -Dflexcore_DIR=<my_prefix>/lib(32|64)/cmake/flexcore
